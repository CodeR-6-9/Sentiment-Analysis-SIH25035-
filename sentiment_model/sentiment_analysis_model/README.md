# sentiment_analysis_model

This folder stores the **trained BERT sentiment classification model**.

## Contents
When the model is saved, you will typically find:
- `pytorch_model.bin` → the model weights
- `config.json` → model configuration (architecture, label mappings, etc.)
- (optional) `training_args.bin` → training arguments if saved

## Notes
- Do **not** edit these files manually; they are generated by Hugging Face’s `save_pretrained()` method.
- Model files are usually large. If committing to GitHub, use **Git LFS**.
- Alternatively, you can host the model on **Hugging Face Hub** and load it directly in the pipeline.
